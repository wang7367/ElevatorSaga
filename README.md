## Challenge Progress
The current algorithm passes the following challenges. Note that the challenges are partially random, so it may take more than one try to pass a challenge in some cases.

| 1 | Transport 15 people in 60 seconds or less | Passing |
| 2 | Transport 20 people in 60 seconds or less | Passing |
| 3 | Transport 23 people in 60 seconds or less | Passing |
| 4 | Transport 28 people in 60 seconds or less | Passing |
| 5 | Transport 100 people in 68 seconds or less | Passing |
| 6 | Transport 40 people in 60 moves or less | Passing |
| 7 | Transport 100 people in 63 moves or less | Passing |
